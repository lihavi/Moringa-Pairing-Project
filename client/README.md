  ## Getting started 
  **Core Functionalities:**
- Login
- Create an account
- The random pairing of students
- Does this without any sort of metrics but ensures that there's no duplication of pairs i.e. keep track of each pair per week
- Data visualization and filters of the pairs spread over the weeks such that on is able to filter out and know that on this week, who was paired with who
- TMs can see the history of pairings

**Future considerations:**
Pair students based on their strengths and weaknesses.
Can they do quiz tests to check their weaknesses and strengths, then be allowed to pair with others based on their weaknesses and strengths?


This application maintains most of the functionalities if not all.
It is an outstanding project usable on all devices, detects signed in users and connects them to their respective accounts.
